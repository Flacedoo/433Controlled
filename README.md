# About

433Controlled is a tool that lets you run programs whenever specific signals are received from a 433 MHz 
Receiver.

Kudos to the project [433Utils](https://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils) from which I got the inspiration 
and adapted to work for me. 
With this, credits also go to [rc-switch](http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch) and [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi), which made the 433Utils project possible.
